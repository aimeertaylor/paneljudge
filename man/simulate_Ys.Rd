\title{Simulate genotype calls for a pair of haploid genotypes}
\usage{
simulate_Ys(fs, ds, k, r, epsilon = 0.001, rho = 7.4 * 10^(-7))
}
\arguments{
\item{fs}{Matrix of marker allele frequencies, i.e. the \eqn{ft}s in [1].
Specifically, a \eqn{m} by \eqn{Kmax} matrix, where \eqn{m} is the marker
count and \eqn{Kmax} is the maximum cardinality (per-marker allele count)
observed over all \eqn{m} markers. If, for any \eqn{t = 1,...,m}, the
maximum cardinality exceeds that of the \eqn{t}-th marker (i.e. if
\eqn{Kmax > Kt}), then all \code{fs[t,1:Kt]} are in (0,1) and all
\code{fs[t,(Kt+1):Kmax]} are zero. For example, if \eqn{Kt = 2} and
\eqn{Kmax = 4} then \code{fs[t,]} might look like \code{[0.3, 0.7, 0, 0]}.}

\item{ds}{Vector of \eqn{m} inter-marker distances, i.e. the \eqn{dt}s in
[1]. The \eqn{t}-th element of the inter-marker distance vector,
\code{ds[t]}, contains the distance between marker \eqn{t} and \eqn{t+1}
such that \code{ds[m] = Inf}, where \eqn{m} is the marker count. (Note that
this differs slightly from [1], where \code{ds[t]} contains the distance
between marker \eqn{t-1} and \eqn{t}). Distances between markers on
different markers are also considered infinite, i.e. if the chromosome of
marker \eqn{t+1} is not equal to the chromosome of \eqn{t}-th marker,
\code{ds[t] = Inf}.}

\item{k}{data-generating switch rate parameter, i.e. \eqn{k} in [1].}

\item{r}{data-generating relatedness parameter, i.e. \eqn{r} in [1].}

\item{epsilon}{Genotyping error, i.e. \eqn{\epsilon} in [1]. The genotyping
error is the probability of miscalling one specific allele for another. As
such, the error rate for the t-th marker, \eqn{(Kt-1)\epsilon}, scales with
\eqn{Kt} (the per-marker allele count, cardinality).}

\item{rho}{Recombination rate, i.e. \eqn{\rho} in [1]. The recombination rate
corresponds to the probability of a crossover per base pair. It is assumed
constant across the genome under the HMM of [1]. Its default value
corresponds to an average rate estimated for \emph{Plasmodium falciparum}
[2].}
}
\value{
Simulated genotype calls for a pair of haploid genotypes, i.e. the
  \eqn{Yt}s of the \eqn{i}-th and \eqn{j}-th haploid genotypes in [1].
  Specifically, a \eqn{m} by 2 matrix, where \eqn{m} is the marker count and
  each column contains a haploid genotype. For all \eqn{t = 1,...,m} markers,
  alleles are enumerated 0 to \eqn{Kt-1}, where \eqn{Kt} is the cardinality
  (per-marker allele count) of the \eqn{t}-th marker. For example, if \eqn{Kt
  = 2}, both \code{Ys[t,1]} and \code{Ys[t,2]} are either 0 or 1.
}
\description{
Given a matrix of marker allele frequencies, a vector of inter-marker
distances, a relatedness parameter, and a switch rate parameter, for a pair
of haploid genotypes \code{simulate_Ys()} returns genotype calls simulated
under the HMM described in [1].
