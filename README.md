# paneljudge
An R package to judge the performance of a panel of genetic markers using simulated data

## Prerequisites

The package **paneljudge** is an R package. It was developed in R version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02) using RStudio. 
To download and install R please go to [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org).
To download and install RStudio please go to [rstudio.com](https://rstudio.com/). 
Please ensure you have the latest version of R or at least version 3.5.1. 

## Installation

A development version of **paneljudge** is available on Github. 
It can be installed in R using `devtools::install_github()` from the **devtools** package (version 2.2.2).
To ensure **paneljudge** installs and the vignette builds, please follow the code below (to ensure you have **devtools** version 2.2.2 or higher) and accept any suggested package updates. 

```r
# Install or update latest stable version of devtools from CRAN
install.packages("devtools")

# Install paneljudge from GitHub 
devtools::install_github("artaylor85/paneljudge", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Usage

The intended usage of the **paneljudge** package is to judge the performance of a panel of genetic markers designed for relatedness inference. Given inter-marker distances and allele frequency estimates provided by the user, performance is judged using data (pairs of haploid genotypes) that are simulated under a hidden Markov model (HMM) [1] of relatedness between monoclonal malaria samples. Under the HMM, markers are treated as categorical random variables whose realisations (alleles) are unordered. Panel performance can be judged in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) and confidence interval width of estimated relatedness (see example figure below), where relatedness is inferred under the same model used to simulate the data. In addition, the effective cardinalities and diversities of the markers can be computed using the input allele frequency estimates. Please read [1] to clarify any questions you might have regarding the HMM, its parameters and related quantities (e.g. effective cardinalities); no attempt is made to explain these details in the package documentation. To better understand the required input (inter-marker distances and allele frequency estimates), please read the comments in the script used to process example data (https://github.com/aimeertaylor/paneljudge/blob/master/data_raw/Process_GTseq.R). A link to this script is also provided via the example data documentation (see code block below). 

Paneljudge can also be used to estimate relatedness between data on real monoclonal samples, providing the data are formatted in the same way as the data simulated under the model.

The package is very minimal. To see its full range of capabilities, simply load and attach **paneljudge**, consult the documentation, read the **paneljudge** vignette and view its source code (see code block below). In addition, you can follow an example analysis stored in https://github.com/artaylor85/paneljudge/tree/master/Analysis_multipanel_multicountry/ by reading `multipanel_multicountry.pdf` and consulting the R markdown script that generated it (`multipanel_multicountry.Rmd`). 

At present, the examples provided do not consider model misspecification; do not account for uncertainty around input allele frequency estimates; do not consider relatedness between pairs of haploid genotypes simulated using different allele frequencies; do not account for missing marker data. Otherwise stated, in the examples provided, the performance of a panel is judged in its most favourable light; it will likely perform less well in reality. Examples of additional experiments that could be done to explore relatedness inference more fully include 

- Impact of multiclonal samples: generate multiclonal samples by grouping together simulated haploid genotypes and assess inference in this misspecified setting (misspecified because the HMM of [1] expects monoclonal samples). 
- Impact of assuming linkage disequilibrium: assess the difference in relatedness inference when treating SNPs within microhaplotypes individually or as nucleotide sequences.

#===============================================================================
# Example of each function using example frequencies and inter-marker distances
#===============================================================================

# Compute diversities and effective cardinalities
compute_diversities(fs = frequencies$Colombia)
compute_eff_cardinalities(fs = frequencies$Colombia)

# Stimulate some data
simulated_Ys <- simulate_Ys(fs = frequencies$Colombia, ds = markers$distances, r = 0.25, k = 5)

# Estimate the switch rate parameter, k, and relatedness parameter, r
krhat <- estimate_r_and_k(fs = frequencies$Colombia, ds = markers$distances, Ys = simulated_Ys)

# Compute confidence intervals (CIs)
compute_r_and_k_CIs(fs = frequencies$Colombia, ds = markers$distances, khat = krhat['khat'], rhat = krhat['rhat'])
```

Possible future additions to the package are listed below. If you would like to contribute, see **Contributing** below or email ataylor@hsph.harvard.edu.

## Future work
- Add errors and warnings for unexpected non-fs input (e.g. ds, k, r, epsilon, rho)
- Make testing_scripts/Tests.R script into unit tests
- Add Rshiny plot of marker positions with dynamic annotations inc. marker name, effective cardinality, diversity etc. 
- Integrate hmmIBD [2], thereby relaxing two compute requirements of the current implementation: the per-marker non-zero followed by zero fs ordering compute requirement; the removal of markers with missing data and thus the re-computation of inter-marker distances each time input haploid genotypes have one or more NA values.
