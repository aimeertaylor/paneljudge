Description: An R package to judge the performance of a panel of genetic markers using data simulated for pairs of haploid genotypes. The data are simulated under a hidden Markov model of relatedness (described in Taylor, A.R., Jacob, P.E., Neafsey, D.E. and Buckee, C.O., 2019. Estimating relatedness between malaria parasites. Genetics, 212(4), pp.1337-1351) using allele frequency estimates provided by the user and marker positions (if available). The markers are treated as point mutations whose alleles are enumerated. The effective cardinalities and diversities of the markers are computed using the input allele frequency estimates; they are summarised using plots and summary statistics. Panel performance is judged in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) and confidence interval width of estimated relatedness, where relatedness is estimated under the same model used to simulate the data. At present, we do not consider model misspecification; we do not account for uncertainty around input allele frequency estimates; we do not consider relatedness between pairs of haploid genotypes simulated using different allele frequencies; we do not account for marker drop-out (markers that fail to produce useful data, e.g. because they a monomorphic). Otherwise stated, at present, the performance of a panel is judged in its most favourable light; it will likely perform less well in reality.
